But unlike other systems, Rippling sits on top of a unified platform.

Today, most companies struggle with everything from routine tasks, like running payroll, to cross-functional planning, like aligning on headcount.

But unlike other systems, Rippling sits on top of a unified platform. Data flows dynamically between Rippling’s applications, giving every team a shared source of truth, the power to automate processes, and access to the insights they need. This allows your business to execute better, faster.\n\nBased in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.2B from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock.\n\nGet help: rippling.com/contact\nLicensing details: https://app.rippling.com/licensing",

This is what we do for industry leaders in education, financial services, insurance, and beyond—over 100 million customer conversations analyzed and counting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The opportunity is massive</strong>. Every company selling to consumers has hundreds of thousands or millions of conversations with their customers each month. These conversations contain the blueprint for the company's growth, yet most organizations only see the tip of the iceberg of what's happening in these interactions. And these aren't small markets—we're talking insurance, travel, financial services, education—industries that form the backbone of the economy. We're not building another point solution. Our AI teammates become essential to every team that touches go-to-market—which is basically everyone at these companies. Sales performance, risk reduction, market intelligence—it all flows from turning real customer conversations into real-time organizational insight and action. When we deploy, we get pulled into C-suite discussions because we're offering more than reports; we're delivering a unified intelligence engine that changes how businesses operate and bends the growth trajectory of their company.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>That's the high level.</strong> Here's where it gets interesting: We've spent years building something different. While others rushed to market with AI that looks good in demos but falls apart in production, we focused on the foundation. We built our own model orchestration platform and AI builder called \"Wavelength\" — tech that captures and amplifies our customers' own expertise in AI models. We ran over 500 experiments to ensure it truly learns to think like your best people. It works.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the stars have aligned. The latest AI capabilities multiply the impact of everything we've built. What once required armies of people happens automatically. Sales reps get served the very best strategies for overcoming tough objections from the AI's observations of all calls with that objection, marketing sees emerging trends before the competition, and product teams discover new feature needs directly from customer calls.</p><p><br></p><p>Our customers see it—they're pulling us into strategic conversations because we're delivering what we promise, and what we promise is like magic to companies that have been operating at 10% visibility for ages. It’s like upgrading from a grainy old tube tv to 4k HD. They can finally understand their customers clearly.</p><p>Our pipeline grows through word of mouth. The product speaks for itself and so we've barely spent on marketing (though that's about to change, because we're ready to scale).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The team is a huge part of this</strong>.<strong> </strong>We've been working together for years and have hit this perfect rhythm. We're scrappy, drama-free, and operate in hours and days, not weeks and months. One VP of Sales said we \"move with the alacrity of a puma\" (did you know pumas move with alacrity?). Our investor described our team as having “midwestern values with an east coast work ethic.” When OpenAI released its groundbreaking o1 model, we had new features live in 2 days that leveraged its incredible capabilities. We talk to every one of our customers multiple times a week. Our guiding principle is \"undeniable value\"—the idea that we deliver such clear ROI that no one questions the investment.</p><p><br></p><p>The results speak for themselves. Our customers come to us with PTSD from clunky, grainy call analysis tools. Once they experience our system, they say they have \"the highest confidence we’ve ever had in any system capability by a landslide.\" We're no longer just part of a vendor evaluation. We're in their strategy sessions, helping them see and seize opportunities they couldn't see and seize before. We believe this is the future of go-to-market: AI teammates that turn every call into deeper organizational intelligence and supercharge every team's performance. We hope you'll join us in building it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We need an exceptional SDR who finds it unbearable not to hit their pipeline goals each week. You'll be working directly with me (Ethan, CEO) to build our go-to-market function from the ground up. This isn't about following a playbook - it's about trying lots of things and figuring out our playbook along the way.</p><p><br></p><p>You'll be crafting targeted outreach campaigns, engaging with multiple stakeholders across organizations, and consistently delivering qualified pipeline week after week. We're looking for someone who can think strategically about which companies and personas will benefit most from our solution, then execute creatively to reach them.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What You'll Actually Do:</strong></p><ul><li>Lead Generation: Hunt for new business opportunities through creative outbound campaigns - you'll be doing this from day one</li><li>Qualification: Have conversations as needed with prospects to determine whether they meet our qualification criteria.</li><li>Pipeline Management: Keep Hubspot accurate and up to date, ruthlessly prioritizing the most promising leads</li><li>Strategy &amp; Execution: Work directly with me to build and refine our top-of-funnel approach</li><li>Multi-threading: Navigate multiple stakeholders within target accounts to build momentum</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Who we’re looking for:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You're entrepreneurial, scrappy, and ready to execute quickly. Here's what matters:</p><ul><li>Track Record: You've been a top performer as a BDR/SDR at a high-velocity startup, or a top performer in another client-facing role such as consulting.</li><li>Tool Proficiency: You know your way around Hubspot, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and similar tools - but you don't depend on them to succeed</li><li>Self-Starter Mindset: You don't wait for permission to solve problems or try new approaches</li><li>Communication: You can articulate complex value propositions clearly and understand the real pain points driving purchase decisions</li><li>Team Player: While you'll often work independently, you collaborate seamlessly with others when needed</li><li>Adaptability: You thrive on change and see ambiguity as an opportunity</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>This isn’t for you if:</strong></p><ul><li>You need extensive tools, materials, and clarity before getting started</li><li>You're focused solely on email metrics and A/B testing</li><li>You want a traditional SDR role with strict playbooks</li><li>You need heavy management oversight to get your job done (if I have to manage your daily activity numbers, it isn't going to work out between us tbh)</li><li>You're uncomfortable with figuring things out as you go</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>How we work:</strong></p><ul><li>Direct collaboration with the CEO and VP of Engineering</li><li>Fast iteration on messaging and approach</li><li>Sales and marketing office in NYC near Union Square</li><li>Focus on what works now, not what scales forever</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>The details:</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive compensation</li><li>Equity that’s meaningful</li><li>Fantastic benefits (including 401k matching, 100% of health benefits covered by us), flexible PTO</li><li>Ground-floor opportunity to shape our sales culture and company</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Ready?</strong></p><p>This really is future-of-work territory. The interface between humans and software is changing dramatically with AI. Some days I find myself spending more time chatting with an AI than my human colleagues — the future is weird and interesting! We don't yet know all the ways this will evolve, but we get to be the architects of it. Hope you’ll consider architecting with us.</p><p><br></p><p>If this resonates:</p><ul><li>Send your LinkedIn profile</li><li>Tell us why this role interests you</li><li>Share your most creative outreach campaign and what made it successful</li></ul><p><br></p><p>We'll respond within 48 hours.

We've been working together for years and have hit this perfect rhythm. We're scrappy, drama-free, and operate in hours and days, not weeks and months. One VP of Sales said we \"move with the alacrity of a puma\" (did you know pumas move with alacrity?). Our investor described our team as having “midwestern values with an east coast work ethic.” When OpenAI released its groundbreaking o1 model, we had new features live in 2 days that leveraged its incredible capabilities. We talk to every one of our customers multiple times a week. Our guiding principle is \"undeniable value\"—the idea that we deliver such clear ROI that no one questions the investment.The results speak for themselves. Our customers come to us with PTSD from clunky, grainy call analysis tools. Once they experience our system, they say they have \"the highest confidence we’ve ever had in any system capability by a landslide.\" We're no longer just part of a vendor evaluation. We're in their strategy sessions, helping them see and seize opportunities they couldn't see and seize before. We believe this is the future of go-to-market: AI teammates that turn every call into deeper organizational intelligence and supercharge every team's performance. We hope you'll join us in building it.The RoleWe need an exceptional SDR who finds it unbearable not to hit their pipeline goals each week. You'll be working directly with me (Ethan, CEO) to build our go-to-market function from the ground up. This isn't about following a playbook - it's about trying lots of things and figuring out our playbook along the way.You'll be crafting targeted outreach campaigns, engaging with multiple stakeholders across organizations, and consistently delivering qualified pipeline week after week. We're looking for someone who can think strategically about which companies and personas will benefit most from our solution, then execute creatively to reach them.What You'll Actually Do:Lead Generation: Hunt for new business opportunities through creative outbound campaigns - you'll be doing this from day oneQualification: Have conversations as needed with prospects to determine whether they meet our qualification criteria.Pipeline Management: Keep Hubspot accurate and up to date, ruthlessly prioritizing the most promising leadsStrategy &amp; Execution: Work directly with me to build and refine our top-of-funnel approachMulti-threading: Navigate multiple stakeholders within target accounts to build momentumWho we’re looking for:You're entrepreneurial, scrappy, and ready to execute quickly. Here's what matters:Track Record: You've been a top performer as a BDR/SDR at a high-velocity startup, or a top performer in another client-facing role such as consulting.Tool Proficiency: You know your way around Hubspot, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and similar tools - but you don't depend on them to succeedSelf-Starter Mindset: You don't wait for permission to solve problems or try new approachesCommunication: You can articulate complex value propositions clearly and understand the real pain points driving purchase decisionsTeam Player: While you'll often work independently, you collaborate seamlessly with others when neededAdaptability: You thrive on change and see ambiguity as an opportunityThis isn’t for you if:You need extensive tools, materials, and clarity before getting startedYou're focused solely on email metrics and A/B testingYou want a traditional SDR role with strict playbooksYou need heavy management oversight to get your job done (if I have to manage your daily activity numbers, it isn't going to work out between us tbh)You're uncomfortable with figuring things out as you goHow we work:Direct collaboration with the CEO and VP of EngineeringFast iteration on messaging and approachSales and marketing office in NYC near Union SquareFocus on what works now, not what scales foreverThe details:Competitive compensationEquity that’s meaningfulFantastic benefits (including 401k matching, 100% of health benefits covered by us), flexible PTOGround-floor opportunity to shape our sales culture and companyReady?This really is future-of-work territory. The interface between humans and software is changing dramatically with AI. Some days I find myself spending more time chatting with an AI than my human colleagues — the future is weird and interesting! We don't yet know all the ways this will evolve, but we get to be the architects of it. Hope you’ll consider architecting with us.If this resonates:Send your LinkedIn profileTell us why this role interests youShare your most creative outreach campaign and what made it successfulWe'll respond within 48 hours.
